Now, on to Ashcroft & Mermin Chapter 7 (pgs 112 - 128)


## Starting off

We looked at the translational symmetries in the previous post. Now we'll consider rotational symmetries.

## Classification of Bravais Lattices (pg. 112)

Classifying all possible crystal structures would be really hard, so we'll start by just looking at how to classify Bravais lattices.

First, lets recall what a Bravais lattice is.

* The **Bravais lattice** of a crystalline solid specifies the periodic array in which the units of the crystal are repeated infinitely in every direction by a set of discrete translation operations.


## Concluding thoughts
This chapter looked at the translational symmetries of lattices. In the next post, we'll look at rotational symmetries.
