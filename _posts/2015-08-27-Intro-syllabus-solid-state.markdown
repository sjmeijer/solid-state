For this site, I'l be looking mostly through Ashcroft and Mermin, with a few others added in here. I will organize roughly topically, but also following the material of A&M.

Here is the planned syllabus:

| Week  | Topic                                       | Chapter  | Related posts  |
|:-----:|:-------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------| ---------- |
| 1     | Overview, what is a solid? Why is it solid? |  19, 20  | [overview]({% post_url 2015-08-27-Overview-what-is-a-solid %})
| 2     | Lattices, space groups, etc.                |  4, 7    |
|  3    | Diffraction, Reciprocal lattice, Brillouin zone | 5, 6 |
| 4     | Phonons, Lattice thermoelastic properties   | 21, 22, 23, Appendix D, F, L, M|
| 5     | Anharmonic effects, thermal conductivity, Grueneisen constant | 25, Appendix O |
