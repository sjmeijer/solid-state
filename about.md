This site is designed as a way of following a solid-state physics course ([here](http://user.physics.unc.edu/~sean/Phys871/)) while producing notes that may be generally useful, as well as keeping myself a bit useful. Please let me know if you find anything useful, or if you notice any incorrect statements. See something that could use some greater depth? Let me know!

You can find the source code for this page  at: [github.com/sjmeijer/solid-state](https://github.com/sjmeijer/solid-state/tree/gh-pages).
